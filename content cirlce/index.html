            The Clover Club Cocktail - History, Recipe, Technique & Variations
            By Rachel
            Origin of the Clover Club Cocktail
            
            The Clover Club cocktail is a long lost delight. As cocktail bars gradually expand their service of classic drinks beyond Old Fashioned's and Sazeracs, this beautiful beverage is beginning to blossom again - and once you taste one, you'll know why. 
            
            In it's heyday the Clover Club was the preferred drink of pre-Prohibition gentlemen. It emerged from a Philadelphia men's group called (you guessed it) the Clover Club that met regularly at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel from the 1880's to the 1920's.  The Clover Club cocktail was likely concocted around the turn of the century, and at first exclusively imbibed by club members: men in legal, literary, or business professions.  When the hotelier of the Bellevue-Stratford, George Boldt, was recruited as proprietor for the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the Clover Club cocktail made its way to New York. </p>
